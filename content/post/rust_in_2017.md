Its almost been a year and a half with Rust and it has been a productive learning experience. Coming as a newbie programmer it made me a lot more insightful and aware of what the knowledge of systems programming really entails and the nuances of it, thanks to the amazing documentation, blogs and community altogether. Maintaining a good community around a language is a hard thing and Rust sets a very good [example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duv0tuPAnO0&list=PLo3w8EB99pqJ74XIGe72c9hBZWz9Y16cY&index=5). Programming in Rust really forced me to get down into the [details of compilers](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/librustc), [llvm IR](https://idea.popcount.org/2013-07-24-ir-is-better-than-assembly/), [formal systems](http://ticki.github.io/blog/a-hoare-logic-for-rust/), [category theory](http://yogsototh.github.io/Category-Theory-Presentation/#slide-0) and what not. At times the language syntax was obscure to understand and took me a time to settle in, but things fell into place. Eventually i ended up working on [Servo](https://github.com/servo/servo) implementing the [foundations](https://github.com/creativcoder/gsoc16) of Service Workers; meanwhile I also contributed to [rustc](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Acreativcoder+is%3Aclosed), [cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/3542) and other rust projects. It is fun :)

Now Rust was at top on Most loved languages of 2016 according to [StackOverflow survey](http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted) and there has been a growing interest among developers who want to get productive in Rust and build software systems that act [reliably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3sfNGtpuxc&list=PLo3w8EB99pqJ74XIGe72c9hBZWz9Y16cY&index=4).

Looking forward towards 2017, Rust community has certain goals and roadmaps put forward and the very first one mentioned there is: [__Rust should have a lower learning curve__](https://github.com/aturon/rfcs/blob/roadmap-2017/text/0000-roadmap-2017.md) and I think I as a programmer having a mere 2 years of real world programming experience and a year an half experience in Rust will be in a better position to highlight what areas of Rust are lacking the clarity that they deserve for a beginner.

I'll list here some of not so clear topics most newcomers to rust faces. Addressing them would help progress Goal [#1](https://github.com/aturon/rfcs/blob/roadmap-2017/text/0000-roadmap-2017.md) of the Rust roadmap 2017.

* _How to be friends with the borrow checker or fighting less with the borrow checker_ - This has been posted quite a few times in stackoverflow, and just recently on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/5ny09j/tips_to_not_fight_the_borrow_checker/), which has received quite valuable advices. Those explanations should really be part of the official documentation to benefit newcomers.

* _When and where to use ref, &_ - This has also been asked by many folks over SO and other places, and its indeed confusing initially. This post covers [them](http://xion.io/post/code/rust-patterns-ref.html) very well.

* _Wrapping the head around different kinds of generic trait params_ : The documentation has less coverage on how extensive, traits can be and that there can be different variants of trait impls, and I think [Different Kind of Code Reuse in Rust](http://cglab.ca/~abeinges/blah/rust-reuse-and-recycle/) should be the part of the official book.

* _Difficult to understand error messages_ - Many have expressed the fact that some of the error messages from the compiler are misleading and some use really technical words. An instance would be [Issue #31174](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/31174) Here, the message `non-scalar` cast for a newcomer sounds a bit technical and really could use a simple explanation.

* _Concept of Lvalue mutability and Rvalue mutability in Rust_ - There are two types of mutability (Lvalue and Rvalue, which gives rise to different cases of statements involving the keyword `mut`:
```
let mut r = some_val;
let r = &mut some_val;
let mut r = &mut some_val;
```
and there are differences in what they mutate. [Here's](https://medium.com/@rsx11/good-old-pointers-cfe8e2727e51#.n6c9zp76i) an article which covers those grounds.

* _Details on ordering of wrapper types_ : and case like whether to use `Option<Box<T>>` or a `Box<Option<T>>` in a struct field.

* _Understanding the module system in Rust_ - A recent twitter [status](https://twitter.com/withoutboats/status/816897015728640000) and the accompanying blog post also mentions about it and we probably should simplify the module system of rust. I personally feel the use of `mod` keyword redundant as `use` could do its work i guess.

* _Macros use cases and various ways of using them_ - [The little book of rust macros](https://danielkeep.github.io/tlborm/book/README.html) is indeed a great intro to them. But we could be helped if there were a repo containing examples of various ways macros are being used in various libraries in Rust and also when not to use them.

* _Correct ways of implementing data structures in Rust_: We need more of them. Alexis's [TooManyLinkedList](http://cglab.ca/~abeinges/blah/too-many-lists/book/) is by far the best one in this segment and i think we probably need more. One of the most common question i hear is the proper way to implement a graph data structure in Rust. [Modelling graphs in Rust](http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2015/04/06/modeling-graphs-in-rust-using-vector-indices/) covers some grounds.

* _The notion of function type implemented as Traits_: The `Fn`, `FnMut` and `FnOnce` traits and how they model the functions in Rust does not come easily to a newcomer as we usually don't see functions having types in other imperative languages (in those language a function is just a function :P). We should have a blog post explaining why functions are attributed to the traits they implement and what semantics does that entail for the programmer.

* _Making sense of lots of lifetimes annotations and minimizing the overhead of reading Rust codebases_: In order to get productive on using rust libraries and also to be able to write some, developers need to quickly get up to speed with understanding different rust codebases. This comes as a blocker as there is a lot of syntax to go through and it takes time. `Lo<'a'>ts of <'a> and <'b><'c' T><U, V, X, Y>`. ðŸ˜±  We would like to have a blog post talking about ways to understand such codebases.

* _Different ways to use built in traits_: [Rust's Built-in Traits, the When, How & Why](https://llogiq.github.io/2015/07/30/traits.html) is a very good introduction. Also real world use case blog posts would be benefited greatly.

* _Tagged Enums/Sum Types_: Sum types are concepts mostly confined to functional languages, and people who do not have a background in functional languages may find them hard to grasp. Understanding the notion of Sum types in Rust (i.e., the Option and Result type) and ways that they can encapsulates multitude of parameterized types within them. This does not come intuitively for a programmer with background from other imperative languages.

To attract more developers, we also need to bring about the motivation to adopt Rust into their toolbelt. A general account and list of code examples with comparision to other languages will really help programmers appreciate the language in a greater sense. There has already been steps taken [here](https://github.com/mgattozzi/rust-from-lang). 
Code reviews like [RipGrep Code Review](http://blog.mbrt.it/2016-12-01-ripgrep-code-review/) are another ways to help people understand how language constructs are put into practice. 

I would encourage newbie rust learners to regularly hang out in the `#rust-beginners` irc channel on `irc.mozilla.org` and just ask away. Rust community is encouraging, very active and eager to help out. Also do read a lot of rust code. Thanks :)
