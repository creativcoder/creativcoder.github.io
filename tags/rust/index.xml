      <title>Meet rustox ! Rust community at Bangalore</title>

      <description>So another rust-lang community got added to the Users group. This time in Bangalore. Its a great opportunity for people interested in learning more about the language and also for rustaceans like us to spread awareness about the benefits of adopting rust to their toolbelt as a systems language.
So at the meetup we started; celebrating 1.0 (May 15) stable release of Rust by cutting the cake. Then we got delivered an awesome pitch by Saifi introducing what rust has to offer, what improvements it brings over other languages, what redundancies it resolves and why one should invest time in learning it.</description>

      <title>Valgrind with Rust - Checking memory leaks in your ffi library</title>

      <description>If you are someone writing Rust wrappers for C libraries, then you might as well wanna verify that you are doing the right cleanups in your destructors or you might ignorantly create potential memory leaks from usage of your library. In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll see how to use the very same tool you use in your c programs, i.e., Valgrind to check for memory leaks in your rust wrapper library.</description>

      <description>Its almost been a year and a half with Rust and it has been a productive learning experience. Coming as a newbie programmer it made me a lot more insightful and aware of what the knowledge of systems programming really entails and the nuances of it, thanks to the amazing documentation, blogs and community altogether. Maintaining a good community around a language is a hard thing and Rust sets a very good example.</description>

      <title>Basic Service Worker Support Lands in Servo</title>

      <description>The last few weeks were exciting. With helpful guidance from Josh and awesome people at Servo I finally have a rudimentary implementation of Service Workers (hereby mentioned as SW) in Servo capable enough to monitor network requests made from different origins and optionally send back custom responses on a registered origin with basic lifecyle events (statechange, activate, install) supported.
Currently, Service Workers are gated behind a dom.serviceworker.enabled flag. To make them available in the DOM, Servo needs to be launched with</description>

      <description>My previous post gave a brief introduction about service workers. This post will be a brief intro to Servo&amp;rsquo;s architectural design in order to provide a context for my next post which will discuss about the initial support for Service Workers that needed to be implemented.
Servo Browser Engine, is a project started by the motivation for exploiting parellelism at every level of rendering and layout and to leverage the growing no of CPU cores we have available today; which current existing browsers are not easily able to exploit because it would require a re-thought on their large legacy codebase.</description>

      <description>So far learning rust has been really rewarding and i found it really interesting in the domain of system&amp;rsquo;s programming; given that we don&amp;rsquo;t have much choices apart from C/C++ for something close to metal. I have started a couple of personal projects of mine in Rust, meltdown and silica. I hope to polish them as i learn more.
Also, I really wanted to start contributing to some open source projects related to Rust, and among them I found one called Servo, a project that is building on modern practices of safe systems programming.</description>

      <title>Using Trait objects in Rust</title>

      <description>This, post aims to give, a very gentle introduction to traits objects in rust aimed at people who already are familiar with Traits in Rust. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know about traits well, a good read is here. A trait is the specification of an interface. That interface can contain functions (both member, and non-member), types and constants. In rust world, they are pretty much everything underlying the constructs we use like operators, functions, loops, and also can serve as identities for marking entities as being thread safe (the Send and Sync).</description>
