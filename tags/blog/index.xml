      <description>So, I migrated my blog to hugo; and after reading a few posts on setting up a new blog with Hugo,I found many of them were really not elaborate enough for newcomers to hugo, and so this post. Hugo is a really lean and fast static site generator written in Go. Now, ill give a high-level overview of how our blog will be setup. Inside our blog repo their will be two branches, once source, which will store only our posts in markdown and other configs and the other branch will be master, which will contain all files generated in the public folder by hugo.</description>
