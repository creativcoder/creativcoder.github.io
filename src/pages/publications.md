### Mastering Rust 2nd edition (2019)
This is the first book I wrote, where I got to learn a lot about writing and understanding the target audience and received a lot of feedback. Hopefully my next book will be even better. But I have decided not to go through a publisher but to make my future publications as open source online content as technology keeps changing.
