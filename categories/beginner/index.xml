      <description>Dynamic programming while being widely applicable to a lot of computer science problems is often found a bit complicated to understand at first but when approached in byte size chunks and appreciating the underlying principles we can understand them better.
This article is aimed at beginner levels so experienced readers may not find it useful though i would love suggestions and improvements from experienced people.
In this post, i&amp;rsquo;ll try to introduce readers who are new to this algorithmic technique of problem solving that can really change the way you think about solving problems.</description>
