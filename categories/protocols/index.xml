      <description>This post, will discuss, about the abstraction that, the &amp;lsquo;user facing&amp;rsquo; internet stands on. I have seen many of my peers ask from time to time, what is http, and how it works. Also as a web developer understanding HTTP protocol is an essential asset to be able to think in a way, as to how to architecture your web apps, so that it follows the semantics of HTTP.
I intend to make things less vague, from what i have learned.</description>
